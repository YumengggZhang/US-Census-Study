The 1900s marked New York City's Progressive Era. With the influence of globalization, this city, as one of the few most important world centers, was attracting people all over the world with different identities to pursue their careers. From 18 century, there came the first surge of immigrants in New York City to pursue their new lives and 1910 is the end year of the first wave. Till 1910, three-fourths of New York City's population were either immigrants or first-generation Americans (i.e. the sons and daughters of immigrants). In this unique time and place at the turn of the century, it became historically significant to study the nationalities and occupations of the immigrants living in New York at that time. To do that, we find the data of the 1910 New York Population Census and we hope to explore the relationship between peopleâ€™s occupations and their nationalities and other identities such as race and gender and use visualization methods to show our results.
